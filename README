Welcome to zcommit.

zcommit allows you to send zephyr notifications by sending an HTTP
POST request to a URL. Currently zcommit supports POST-backs from
github. If you would like it to support another form of POST-back,
please let us know (zcommit@mit.edu).

== URL structure ==

The URL you post to is structured as follows:
http://zcommit.mit.edu/$type/$key1/$value1/$key2/$value2/.... So for
example, the URL
http://zcommit.mit.edu/github/class/zcommit/instance/commit is parsed
as having type github, class zcommit, and instance commit. Using this
information, zcommit figures out how to form a useful message which is
then sends as a zephyr.

== Types ==

==== Github ====

Set your POST-back URL to
http://zcommit.mit.edu/github/class/$classname, followed by any of the
following optional key/value parameters:

    * /instance/$instance
    * /zsig/$zsig
    * /sender/$sender
